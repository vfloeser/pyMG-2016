## Notes for Developers

### Run Test Suite

We use [nose][] for our tests.
Simply follow the general guides on Python `unittest` and *nosetest*.


### Update and Build Documentation

We use [Sphinx][sphinx] with it's bundled [autosummary][] and [autodoc][] extensions as the
documentation processor.

As soon as a new file, class or module is created either in `pymg` or `project`, it is required to
rerun *autodoc* to pick up the new stuff.
To do this run this handy script we wrote in the root of the project:

    ./docs/update_apidocs.sh

To just rebuild the documentation, change into the `docs` folder and run

    make html
